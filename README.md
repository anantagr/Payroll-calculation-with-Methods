# Payroll-calculation-with-Methods
 Description:         This program will prepare a Pay Slip to be included in a cheque envelope for the employees
                      of a small business. The Pay Slip will also be used by the accountant to prepare the actual 
                      pay-cheques, and to record the deductions in a company ledger.

                      This program will promp the user for the following:
                      1. Name of the Employee (the name to appear on the slip)
                      2. Number of hours worked by the employee
                      3. Pay rate per hour $$
                      4. %tage of gross pay deduction (only in whole numbers) %

 Information provided by the user:
                      In order to calculate the net pay for an employee, we use following formulae:
                      1. Gross pay = Number of hours worked * Pau rate per hour
                      2. Deduction amount = Gross pay * %tage of deduction
                      3. Net pay = Gross pay - Deduction amount

 Final output of the application:
                      After the calculation is completed, we will display the following information:
                      1. Employee name
                      2. Number of hours worked
                      3. Pay rate per hour $$
                      4. Gross pay $$
                      5. Deduction amount $$
                      6. Net pay $$

                      There were no compilation errors in the program

  Assumption:         Employee's pay rate remain constant for the entire pay period.
